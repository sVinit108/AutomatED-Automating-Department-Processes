We developed a Flutter WebApp that automates and streamlines the processes of a college's Training and Placement Cell as part of our final year B.Tech project.

The project automates CRUD operations and provides graphical analysis of students' training and placement data. It includes filtering options that allow data to be filtered based on data columns (i.e., tuple identifiers) and displays value columns.
