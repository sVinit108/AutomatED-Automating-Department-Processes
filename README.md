📌 AutomatED — Automating Department Processes

A Training & Placement Cell Automation System

AutomatED is a Flutter-based web application developed as part of our B.Tech Final Year Project to automate and streamline the core operations of a college Training and Placement Cell (TPC).

The system digitizes routine administrative workflows, enables structured data management, and provides actionable insights through interactive analytics.

🎯 Problem Statement

Training and Placement Cells often rely on manual data handling, spreadsheets, and fragmented tools, leading to:

Redundant data entry

Difficulty in tracking student records

Limited visibility into placement statistics

Time-consuming reporting and analysis

💡 Solution Overview

AutomatED provides an end-to-end web-based solution that centralizes student and placement data while enabling efficient management and analysis.

Key objectives:

Reduce manual effort in TPC operations

Improve data consistency and accessibility

Enable quick insights for decision-making

📄 Project Context

This project was developed as part of the Bachelor of Engineering (Computer Engineering) Final Year Project, focusing on applying software engineering principles to solve a real institutional problem.

🏗️ System Architecture

The overall system architecture follows a modular design where user interactions are routed through a centralized application layer that handles data management and analytics.

High-level workflow:

Users interact with dashboards or data-entry modules

The application layer manages CRUD operations and requests

Data is fetched from the database and processed for analytics

Graphs and visual insights are generated dynamically
